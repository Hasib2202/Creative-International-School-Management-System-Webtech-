## Project Overview
The Creative International School Management System is a comprehensive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL (with XAMPP) to manage day-to-day activities within a school. The system is designed to streamline administrative, teaching, and library processes, while offering role-specific features for Admins, Teachers, Students, and Librarians.

## Features Overview

The Admin is responsible for managing users (teachers, students, librarians), creating courses, publishing notices, and overseeing overall system functionality. Admins have full access to all modules within the system.

### 2. Teacher
Teachers have functionalities such as managing student attendance, uploading class materials, publishing and managing notices, and reviewing student performance and requests.

### 3. Student
Students can view class schedules, notices, and results, submit assignments, request leave, and manage their library accounts.

### 4. Librarian
Librarians manage the library system by overseeing books, issuing, and returning books, managing accounts, and processing fine payments.
